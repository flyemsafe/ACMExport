# ACM Export

This project contains the code and the export for the Automating Content Management Blog. The code is used to export the configuration of the ACM Credentials, Projects, Inventories and Templates. The project also contains the code to import the content back into ansible automation platform. If you are using this repo with the blog, you can either edit the code here and run it to create your ansible config or run the import code as is and modify the configuration using the AAP Web UI, whichever you find more convenient.
